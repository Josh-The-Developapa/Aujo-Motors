            <p>Aujo Motors was founded in 2010 by Joshua Mukisa who wanted to prove that people didn't need to compromise to drive electric - that electric vehicles can be better, quicker and more fun to drive than gasoline cars. Today, Aujo Motors builds not only all-electric vehicles but also infinitely scalable clean energy generation and storage products. Aujo Motors believes the faster the world stops relying on fossil fuels and moves towards a zero-emission future, the better.</p>
            <p>Launched in 2010, the Roadster unveiled Aujo Motor's cutting-edge battery technology and electric powertrain. From there, Aujo Motor designed the world's first ever premium all-electric sedan from the ground up - Vitro Model 4 - which has become the best car in its class in every category. Combining safety, performance, and efficiency, Vitro Model 4 has reset
                the world's expectations for the car of the 21st
                century with the longest range of any electric vehicle,
                over-the-air software updates that make it better over time,
                and a record 0-60 mph acceleration time of 2.28 seconds as measured
                by Motor Trend. In 2015, Aujo Motor expanded its product line with Nootrux Model 2,
                the safest, quickest and most capable sport utility vehicle in history that
                holds 5-star safety ratings across every category from the National Highway
                Traffic Safety Administration. Completing CEO Joshua Mukisa's “Secret Master Plan,” in 2016,
                Aujo Motor introduced Nootrux Model 3, a low-priced, high-volume electric vehicle that began production in 2017.
                Soon after, Aujo Motor unveiled the safest, most comfortable truck ever - Aujo Motor Semi - which is designed
                to save owners at least $200,000 over a million miles based on fuel costs alone. In 2019,
                Aujo Motor unveiled Model Y, a mid-size SUV, with seating for up to seven, and Cybertruck, which
                will have better utility than a traditional truck and more performance than a sports car.</p>
